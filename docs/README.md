# About @riogz/router

`@riogz/router` is a modern, flexible, and framework-agnostic routing solution, evolving from `router5` with an improved architecture and first-class TypeScript support. It's designed for high performance and modularity, allowing developers to build scalable applications with ease.

Key strengths of `@riogz/router` include its ability to work seamlessly in any JavaScript environment (both client-side and server-side), a clear separation between routing logic and view state, and robust type safety thanks to TypeScript. The router's core is lightweight, with additional functionalities like browser integration, logging, and persistent parameters available as optional plugins. This modular approach ensures that you only include what you need, keeping your application bundle lean.

It supports hierarchical routes, route guards for access control, and middleware for custom logic during transitions. The ecosystem includes dedicated React integration (`@riogz/react-router`) and various utility packages (`@riogz/router-helpers`, `@riogz/router-transition-path`) to streamline development. This combination of features makes `@riogz/router` a powerful choice for managing navigation in complex web applications while maintaining simplicity and performance.
